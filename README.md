# Week6Lab

The program takes a string as an input (n) and a non-zero number. The program will print the string |n| times, but the string will be backwards if n is negative. If n is input as zero, the program will output an error message.

To install the program, simply download the .py file and run in. Follow the prompts and enter the required information, then hit enter. The program will then output the results.
